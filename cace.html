    <h2>To bake a simple and delicious birthday cake follow these steps:</h2>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<p>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p>
    1 ½ cups sugar
</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>1 cup milk</p>
 <h4> Instructions:</h4>
 <p>1.Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</p>
 <p>2.Prepare Dry Ingredients: In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.</p>
 <p>3.Mix Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>
 <p>4.Combine Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix just until combined.</p>
 <p>5.Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</p>
 <p>6.Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
 <p>7.Decorate: Once cooled, frost the cakes with your choice of frosting (buttercream is popular), and decorate with sprinkles, fruit, or other toppings. Write "Happy Birthday" with icing or decorate as you like.
